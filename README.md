## Lunar Anomalies: NASA’s 100 Years of Mysteries

This project dives into NASA’s “100 Years of Lunar Anomalies” dataset, which includes information on the year, month, description, date, and credits of each lunar event. Using Python and statistical analysis, we addressed a series of fascinating questions about the Moon, such as:
	•	Why does the Moon have fewer moonquakes than Earth has earthquakes?
	•	Why are there no volcanoes on the Moon?
	•	Why does the far side of the Moon have fewer maria than the near side?
	•	Why does the Moon have a weaker magnetic field than Earth?

As part of a course I took, we used statistical methods, image segmentation, edge detection, and template matching techniques to analyze the data and detect abnormalities on the Moon’s surface. Through this process, we were able to uncover insights and draw conclusions about some of the most intriguing mysteries of the lunar landscape.
